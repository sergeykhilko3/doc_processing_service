# Service Reliability Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive reliability enhancements made to the document processing service to prevent service failures and ensure automatic recovery.

## üéØ Problem Analysis

The original service had several critical failure points that could cause permanent outages:

1. **Redis Connection Failures** - No retry logic, service would fail if Redis was unavailable
2. **Resource Exhaustion** - No memory/CPU limits, could cause OOM kills
3. **Disk Space Issues** - Temp files could fill up storage
4. **Textract Hangs** - No circuit breaker for external processing
5. **Poor Health Monitoring** - Limited visibility into service state
6. **Ungraceful Shutdowns** - No cleanup during container restarts

## ‚úÖ Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Health Checks (`health_checks.py`)

**Features:**
- Individual component health checks (Redis, Celery worker, Celery beat, disk space)
- Memory usage monitoring with thresholds
- Disk space monitoring with warning/critical levels
- Command-line interface for manual testing

**Usage:**
```bash
python health_checks.py redis          # Check Redis only
python health_checks.py celery-worker  # Check Celery worker
python health_checks.py all            # Check all components
```

### 2. Redis Connection Manager (`redis_manager.py`)

**Features:**
- Exponential backoff retry logic (5 attempts with increasing delays)
- Connection pooling and health monitoring
- Automatic reconnection on failures
- Configurable timeouts and retry parameters

**Benefits:**
- Service survives Redis restarts
- Automatic recovery from network issues
- Reduced connection overhead

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern (`circuit_breaker.py`)

**Features:**
- Protects against cascading textract failures
- Three states: CLOSED (normal), OPEN (failing), HALF_OPEN (testing)
- Configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts
- Specialized implementation for textract operations

**Configuration:**
- Opens after 3 consecutive failures
- Waits 2 minutes before testing recovery
- Requires 2 successes to fully close

### 4. Graceful Shutdown Management (`graceful_shutdown.py`)

**Features:**
- Signal handlers for SIGTERM/SIGINT
- Request tracking to wait for completion
- Cleanup callbacks for temp files and connections
- Configurable shutdown timeout (30s default)

**Benefits:**
- Clean shutdowns prevent data loss
- No interrupted file processing
- Proper resource cleanup

### 5. Comprehensive Monitoring (`monitoring.py`)

**New Endpoints:**
- `/metrics` - Detailed system and service metrics
- `/health/detailed` - Component-level health status
- `/status` - Quick service status overview

**Metrics Collected:**
- System: CPU, memory, disk usage, load average
- Service: uptime, request counts, response times, temp files
- Redis: memory usage, connection status
- Circuit breaker: state and failure counts

### 6. Docker Compose Enhancements

**Resource Limits:**
```yaml
doc-converter:
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 1G
        cpus: '1.0'
      reservations:
        memory: 512M
        cpus: '0.5'
```

**Health Checks:**
- All services now have health checks
- Redis persistence enabled
- Improved restart policies

### 7. Enhanced Error Handling

**Improvements:**
- Structured error responses
- Request metrics tracking
- Circuit breaker integration
- Graceful degradation during overload

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Redis Configuration
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://redis:6379/0

# Resource Limits
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH=16777216  # 16MB file size limit

# API Security
API_KEY=your_secure_api_key

# Service Tuning (optional)
REDIS_MAX_RETRIES=5
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=3
SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=30
```

### Health Check Thresholds

- **CPU Warning**: >70%, **Critical**: >90%
- **Memory Warning**: >80%, **Critical**: >90%
- **Disk Warning**: >80%, **Critical**: >90%
- **Temp Files Warning**: >500MB

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Service Health**: `/health/detailed` endpoint status
2. **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk from `/metrics`
3. **Request Metrics**: Success rate, response times
4. **Circuit Breaker**: State changes (OPEN indicates issues)
5. **Temp Files**: Size and count growth

### Sample Monitoring Queries

```bash
# Check overall health
curl -H "X-API-Key: your_key" http://localhost:5001/health/detailed

# Get detailed metrics
curl -H "X-API-Key: your_key" http://localhost:5001/metrics

# Quick status check
curl -H "X-API-Key: your_key" http://localhost:5001/status
```

## üß™ Testing

### Enhanced Test Suite (`test_enhanced_service.py`)

**Test Categories:**
- Basic health checks
- Detailed component health
- Metrics collection
- Document conversion
- Circuit breaker behavior

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run all tests
python test_enhanced_service.py --url http://localhost:5001 --api-key your_key

# Run specific tests
python test_enhanced_service.py --test metrics
python test_enhanced_service.py --test circuit-breaker
```

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Update environment variables in docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Configure proper API_KEY
- [ ] Adjust resource limits based on expected load
- [ ] Set up external monitoring for health endpoints

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify all health checks pass
- [ ] Test document conversion functionality
- [ ] Monitor resource usage and adjust limits if needed
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical metrics

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure alerts for `/health/detailed` failures
- [ ] Monitor CPU/memory usage trends
- [ ] Track circuit breaker state changes
- [ ] Monitor temp file growth

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Service Won't Start:**
1. Check Redis connectivity: `python health_checks.py redis`
2. Verify resource limits aren't too restrictive
3. Check application logs for startup errors

**High Resource Usage:**
1. Check `/metrics` endpoint for detailed usage
2. Monitor temp file cleanup job
3. Adjust resource limits in docker-compose.yml

**Circuit Breaker Open:**
1. Check textract service status
2. Review error logs for repeated failures
3. Wait for automatic recovery or restart service

**Slow Response Times:**
1. Monitor CPU/memory usage
2. Check temp file accumulation
3. Review request metrics and patterns

## üìà Performance Improvements

The reliability enhancements also provide performance benefits:

- **Reduced Latency**: Connection pooling reduces Redis overhead
- **Better Throughput**: Resource limits prevent resource contention
- **Faster Recovery**: Circuit breaker prevents hanging on failed operations
- **Efficient Cleanup**: Automated temp file management prevents disk issues

## üîê Security Considerations

- Redis is not exposed externally (internal Docker network only)
- API key authentication required for all management endpoints
- Resource limits prevent DoS attacks through resource exhaustion
- Graceful shutdown prevents data exposure during restarts

These improvements transform the service from a basic Flask application into a production-ready, resilient microservice that can handle failures gracefully and recover automatically.
