# üîß QUICK FIX - Container Health Issues

## The Problem
Your containers were unhealthy because Docker volumes were caching old code, preventing the new `app_full.py` from running.

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### 1. Validate Everything is Ready
```bash
./validate_build.sh
```
Should show all ‚úÖ green checkmarks.

### 2. Deploy Fresh (No Cache)
```bash
./deploy_fresh.sh
```
This removes old containers/images and rebuilds everything fresh.

### 3. Verify All Healthy
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
After ~90 seconds, all containers should show `Up (healthy)`.

## Expected Result
```
         Name                        Command                  State                    Ports                  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algiers_celery-beat_1      ./startup.sh celery -A app ...   Up (healthy)                                   
algiers_celery-worker_1    ./startup.sh celery -A app ...   Up (healthy)                                   
algiers_doc-converter_1    ./startup.sh gunicorn -w 2 ...   Up (healthy)   0.0.0.0:5001->5000/tcp         
algiers_redis_1            docker-entrypoint.sh redis ...   Up (healthy)   6379/tcp                        
```

## What Changed
- ‚ùå Removed: `app_code:/app` volume mounts (were caching old code)
- ‚úÖ Added: Fresh deployment scripts with `--no-cache` builds
- ‚úÖ Fixed: All services now use `app_full.py` with Office support
- ‚úÖ Added: Comprehensive health checks and startup validation

If any container remains unhealthy after 90 seconds, check logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs [service-name]
```
